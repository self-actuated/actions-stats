Includes total runtime of all workflow runs and workflow jobs, including where the jobs were run within inclusive, free, billed minutes, or on self-hosted runners.

This data is not available within a single endpoint in GitHub's REST or GraphQL APIs, so many different API calls are necessary to build up the usage statistics.

```
repos = ListRepos(organisation || user)
   for each Repo
       ListWorkflowRuns(Repo)
          for each WorkflowRun
             jobs = ListWorkflowJobs(WorkflowRun)
sum(jobs)
```

If your team has hundreds of repositories, or thousands of builds per month, then the tool may exit early due to exceeding the API rate-limit. In this case, we suggest you run with `--days=10` and multiply the value by 3 to get a rough picture of 30-day usage.

## Usage

This tool is primarily designed for use with an organisation, however you can also use it with a regular user account by changing the `--org` flag to `--user`.

Or create a [Classic Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with: repo and admin:org and save it to ~/pat.txt. Create a short lived duration for good measure.

We recommend using arkade to install this CLI, however you can also download a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/self-actuated/actions-usage/releases).

```sh
# sudo is optional for this step
curl -SLs https://get.arkade.dev | sudo sh

arkade get actions-usage
sudo mv $HOME/.arkade/bin/actions-usage /usr/local/bin/
```

## Collecting usage before you sign up to actuated.dev

We sometimes ask users to run this tool before a call with the [actuated team](https://actuated.dev). It helps us gauge your usage, find potential wins and recommend a plan/server.

```bash
actions-usage \
 --by-repo
 --punch-card \
 --org openfaas \
 --token-file ~/pat.txt \
 --days 28
```

If you have either a large or a busy repo - you may want to run with `--days 14` or `--days 7` once your rate limit has reset.

```bash
curl -L \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/pat.txt)"\
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/rate_limit
```

## Output

Example output:

```

```

You can also run the tool against your personal account:

```bash
actions-usage --user alexellis --token-file ~/pat.txt
```

Get a punch-card of which days have the most commits by adding the `-punch-card` flag:

```
Day            Builds
Monday         7
Tuesday        22
Wednesday      43
Thursday       49
Friday         19
Saturday       4
Sunday         12
Total          156
```

You can use the `-by-repo` flag to get a detailed breakdown of usage by GitHub repository - sorted by number of builds.

```
Longest build: 4h12m40s
Average build time: 2m37s

## Author

This tool was created as part of [actuated](https://actuated.dev) - secure, fast BYO runners for GitHub Actions. actuated is developed by [OpenFaaS Ltd](https://openfaas.com).

Within the dashboard, customers get built-in charts for overall usage on a GitHub organisation and a repo-level break down of passing/failing builds and total time spent in each.
